# Open-SOURCE CAN Protocol Stack üöÄ

**A free, open-source implementation of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol stack for embedded systems.**

---

## üìå Overview
This project provides a flexible and lightweight **open-source CAN protocol stack** designed for embedded systems. Its core feature is an **interactive web-based configuration wizard** that simplifies the setup and deployment of CAN communication for various microcontrollers and operating systems.

Built with developers in mind, this MIT-licensed project aims to streamline CAN stack integration by offering:
- **Simplified Code Generation**: Automatically generate tailored C code based on user configuration.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Target different MCUs (STM32, ESP32, AVR, etc.) and OS environments (Bare-metal, FreeRTOS, AUTOSAR).
- **Protocol Flexibility**: Configure standard CAN 2.0A/B, CAN FD, and potentially higher-level protocols like CANopen, J1939, and UDS through the wizard.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrate the generated, self-contained code into your existing embedded projects.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Clear guides and examples to get you started quickly.

## üöÄ Features
- **Interactive Web Configuration Wizard**:
    - **Platform Selection**: Choose target MCU and Operating System (Bare-metal, FreeRTOS, AUTOSAR).
    - **Protocol Configuration**: Select CAN standard (CAN 2.0A/B, CAN FD) and configure parameters (baud rate, filters). Supports setup for higher-level protocols (CANopen, J1939, UDS).
    - **DBC File Upload**: Import `.dbc` files to define messages and signals.
    - **Message Editor**: Define and configure CAN messages, including IDs, DLC, and signals.
    - **Code Preview & Download**: Instantly preview and download the generated C code tailored to your configuration.
- **Protocol Compliance**: Adherence to CAN 2.0A/B and CAN FD standards.
- **Message Framing**: Support for standard/extended identifiers and flexible Data Length Codes (DLC).
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms for error detection and reporting (implementation details may vary by target).
- **Modular Generated Code**: The output code is designed for easy integration.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Generates code compatible with various MCUs like STM32, AVR, ESP32, and potentially others.

## üõ† Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:choudharyom/open-source_can_stack.git
   cd open-source-can-stack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the web interface (for configuration generation)**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the configuration wizard.

4. **Generate code for your device**
   Use the web interface to:
   - Select your MCU/OS
   - Configure protocol parameters
   - Download generated code for your system

---

## üõ† Usage Example
1. Visit the web interface at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Configure your CAN parameters:
   - Baud rate (e.g., 125 kbps)
   - Message ID formats
   - Payload structures
3. Select your target hardware (e.g., STM32 Nucleo board)
4. Download pre-configured C code
5. Integrate the generated code into your embedded system
